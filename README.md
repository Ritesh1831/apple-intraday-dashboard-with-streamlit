# 📈 Apple Intraday Dashboard with Streamlit

This project is part of my learning and exploration of **Streamlit** for building interactive dashboards.  
Here, I have created an **intraday price and volume analysis dashboard** for Apple Inc. (**AAPL**) using real-time data.

---

## ✅ What I’ve done

- 📊 Fetched **AAPL** intraday stock data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
- 🕒 Implemented **auto-refresh** to update data at a custom interval.
- 🗂️ Designed **multiple pages**:  
  - **Price & Volume Charts**
  - **Distribution & Correlation**
- 📉 Plotted line charts for **Close Price**, **OHLC**, and **Volume Over Time**.
- 🕯️ Added a **Candlestick Chart** for better market movement visualization.
- 📊 Created histograms for **Close Prices** and **Volumes**.
- 🔥 Added a **Correlation Heatmap** to see relationships between price metrics.
- 🧮 Computed and plotted a **20-period Moving Average** alongside Close Price.

---

## 📌 Insights

- The Close Price chart shows stable intraday movement with occasional sharp dips.
- OHLC prices mostly align tightly, indicating low volatility in short periods.
- The Candlestick Chart helps spot sudden spikes/dips clearly.
- Correlation Heatmap shows how **Open**, **High**, **Low**, **Close**, and **Volume** relate.
- Histogram shows that most Close Prices cluster in a tight range during this intraday window.
